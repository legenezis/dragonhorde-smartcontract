# Cadena PROJECT 3 -- Dragon Horde Smart Contract

This contract essentially creates a treasury.

The deployer of the contract becomes the treasurer, represented as the "dragon" who governs a horde of gold. The dragon can appoint or retire minions, who are able to request gold. Anyone can contribute gold to the horde, but only minions can request gold.

Approval of gold requests depends on whether or not the dragon is in a good mood. Gold contributions puts the dragon in a good mood. Approving gold requests puts the dragon in a bad mood. Mood can also be set manually.

Do take a look!
